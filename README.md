## Hi 👋, I'm Jenna, a professional business analyst

I’m a resilient and growth-driven employee transitioning into Business Intelligence after building a diverse career in healthcare, transcription, and document control. My experience as a single mom of four has strengthened my ability to prioritize, solve problems creatively, and stay focused under pressure. 

I’m currently enrolled in a BI bootcamp, developing skills in data analytics, SQL, Tableau, Power BI, and strategic decision-making. 
I’m excited to apply my operational experience and attention to detail to data-driven work, and I welcome connections or opportunities.
